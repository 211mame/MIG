What I propose is a Musical Instrument Generating application using machine learning .
This application, which I aim to develop, takes audio signal data as input and outputs 3D data of a wind instrument capable of producing the tone of the input data and I hope that the completion of this application will create an instrument with a unique tone.<br>
Progress of development is here â†’ https://yhvhcamus.wixsite.com/yutasuzukimig
